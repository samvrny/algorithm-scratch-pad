# Algorithm Scratch Pad

## Description
This project is a place where I am writing and testing various algorithms, learning from the Zero To Mastery Academy. This application will not be likely to have a deployed version, and is really only being added to Github to demonstrate in my Github that I am actively writing code and learning new things, even if I am not actively building web applications.
